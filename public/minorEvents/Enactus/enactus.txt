1. Mind Sway: “Progress is impossible without change”. On that note, ENACTUS MUJ, with its team invites students to come change our minds. 
We are a stubborn lot and even the slightest chink in our armor will prove your radical persuasion. 
There will be desk set-ups with working team members and a bowl full of topics ranging from taboo to funny to controversial.
Students are to come and try and change our stubborn minds on these topics. If they succeed, they're going to be rewarded.

2. Grapvine Buzz: "Where feelings mobilize, people empathize." This is the theme that ENACTUS aims to harness, instill, and fulfill amongst all this Oneiros. 
With an event that aims to build the connectivity between the well-fed and unfed, we aim to bridge the gap between sects and forge strong empathy inside 
the next entrepreneurial leaders of our generation.
For the event, ENACTUS will be inviting underprivileged students to campus, and they'll be working together in sync.
For the first half of the event, both MUJ and underprivileged children will be painting a huge board which we are calling 'The Wall of ENACTUS'. 
The Wall is going to be painted on the theme of ENACTUS being the chapter of Manipal University Jaipur.
For the second half, students throughout are expected to jot down their ideas and pit up on this Wall.
Once we receive maximum ideas, we're going to put the ideas through a series of competitions to come up with the best one.
